#Game Of Life  
My take on [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Self-replication). Built in Sinatra and written in Ruby and JavaScript.

##Setup:
- Fork and clone  
- From the command line:  
  - Install dependencies: `bundle install`  
  - Start the server: `rackup`  
  - Open in browser: `localhost:9292`  

You can run specs with:

- `rspec`
